Overview of the Game:
The idea of the project was inspired by the classic gameplay of Super Mario. Having grown up with the Nintendo version, I wanted to explore how this iconic platformer game would translate to a third-person game environment. Given that Mario is a trademarked character, I have implemented assets from the Unity Assets store that evoke a similar aesthetic and atmosphere, aiming to capture the nostalgic feel and essence of the original game. My goal is for players familiar with Super Mario to experience a sense of familiarity and enjoyment while engaging with this re-imagined experience.
The main parts of the game are:
•	Player: White blob (Mario). 
•	Game features: 
o	First level: The goal is to recreate the feel of a classic starter Mario level. Players will jump on enemies (mushrooms) to defeat them and navigate platforms to progress.
o	Second level: This level emulates a mid-game boss stage with a darker atmosphere. Lava is introduced as an enemy, adding an extra layer of challenge.
o	Third level: The final battle simulates a confrontation with the main villain (Bowser). The player can now gain abilities by collecting power-ups like the fire-shooting flower and the growth-enhancing mushroom.
•	Enemies: 
o	Small enemies: (The evil mushrooms) patrol back and forth along a Vector3 path. When they spot the player (Mario), they make a small jump and begin chasing him, similar to their behaviour in classic Super Mario games.
The final boss: (Bowser) has 5 lives and takes damage when the player either jumps on him or hits him with fireballs.
